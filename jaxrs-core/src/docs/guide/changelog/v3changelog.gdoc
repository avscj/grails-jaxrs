h3. Version 3.1.0
* Upgrade to support Grails 3.3.x (huge thanks [Alex Stoia|https://github.com/avscj]!)

h3. Version 3.0.4
* Integrate *Swagger* into the @jaxrs-jersey1@ plugin.
* Introduce the @jaxrs-swagger-ui@ plugin.

h3. Version 3.0.3
* Added missing @jersey-client@ dependency for the *jersey1* plugin.\
  ([#25|https://github.com/budjb/grails-jaxrs/issues/25])
* Refactored JAX-RS servlet initialization order due to call order differences between the embedded tomcat\
  server and the standalone tomcat server. ([#26|https://github.com/budjb/grails-jaxrs/issues/26])

h3. Version 3.0.2
* Add @ResourceRegistrar@ and @ScanningResourceRegistrar@ so that applications and plugins can provide a set of\
  resources or providers outside of the normal artefact scanning process.
* Move integration tests out of the @jaxrs-core@ plugin and into the @jaxrs-integration-test@ plugin.
* Add tests to the @jaxrs-restlet@ plugin.
* Changed how URL mappings work:
  * URL mappings are no longer configured statically via application configuration.
  * URL mappings are compiled by scanning resource classes and their methods, and a new URL mapping entry will be added\
    per unique path. This works for both resource classes present in @grails-app/resources@ and other resource classes\
    registered via other means.
* Update restlet to 2.3.6.

h3. Version 3.0.1
* Fix *jaxrs-core* plugin descriptor class name.
* Compile the plugin with JDK 1.7 compatibility.
* Update authors.
* Fill in missing information in plugin descriptor files.
* Lowered Grails version requirement to 3.0.0.

h3. Version 3.0.0
This is the initial release of the *jaxrs* project for Grails 3. Structurally, this is a major refactor from the
existing codebase. Procedurally, the plugin has not changed much.

Major changes include:
* Plugin has been broken up into several plugins.
  ** *jaxrs-core* contains the base logic for the plugin but will not work standalone.
  ** *jaxrs-jersey1* uses the Jersey 1.9 implementation.
  ** *jaxrs-restlet* uses the Restlet 2.1.4 implementation.
  ** *jaxrs-integration-test* provides base classes to test resources in integration tests.
* Most source files have been changed from @\*.java@ to @\*.groovy@ files.
* Many class packages have changed, and all class packages have been moved under @org.grails.plugins.jaxrs@.
* Grails-generated [documentation|http://budjb.github.io/grails-jaxrs/latest/] has been created.
* Ownership and maintenance of the project has been transferred.
